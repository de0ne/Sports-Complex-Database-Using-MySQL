## ABOUT THE PROJECT
In this project, I built a simple database that helped manage the booking process of a sports complex. The sports complex has the following facilities:

2 tennis courts
2 badminton courts
2 multi-purpose fields and
1 archery range

### Additional details
Only registered users are allowed to make a booking.

After booking, the complex allows users to cancel their bookings latest by the day before the booked date.

Cancellation is free. However, if this is the third (or more) consecutive cancellation, the complex imposes a $10 fine.
